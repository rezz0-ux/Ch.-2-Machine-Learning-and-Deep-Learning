Setiap parameter, seperti bobot dan bias, termasuk dalam kategori trainable karena mereka diperbarui secara bertahap melalui proses backpropagation. Jika ada parameter yang tidak ingin dilatih, biasanya kita harus secara eksplisit menonaktifkannya, misalnya dengan mengatur atribut requires_grad=False, tetapi dalam kasus ini, semua parameter disiapkan untuk dilatih sehingga totalnya sama."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IU8zMjOQZCFX"},"source":["### Train the Model"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"xqITlQXCZCFX","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729524038476,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":1066544,"user":{"displayName":"Aldona","userId":"04790550936434020598"}},"outputId":"245ace52-a299-459e-e9bd-b944311e5512"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Start training ...\n","  - Epoch: 0 \tTraining_loss: 0.001613\n","  - Epoch: 10 \tTraining_loss: 0.000044\n","  - Epoch: 20 \tTraining_loss: 0.000020\n","  - Epoch: 30 \tTraining_loss: 0.000013\n","  - Epoch: 40 \tTraining_loss: 0.000009\n"]}],"source":["print(\"Start training ...\")\n","for epoch in range(epochs):\n","    train_loss = 0.0\n","    model.train()\n","\n","    for data, label in Train_dataset:\n","        data = data.to(device)\n","        label = label.squeeze()\n","        label = label.to(device)\n","        optimizer.zero_grad()\n","        output = model.forward(data.float())\n","\n","        loss = criterion(output.squeeze(), label.float())\n","        loss.backward()\n","        optimizer.step()\n","        train_loss += loss.item()\n","\n","    train_loss = train_loss / len(Train_dataset.dataset)\n","    if(epoch % 10 == 0):\n","        print('  - Epoch: {} \\tTraining_loss: {:.6f}'.format(epoch, train_loss))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CL3lJaDVZCFY"},"source":["### Model ACCURACY should reach >= 95%"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ReIlo4acxGCR"},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO: Jika akurasi masih dibawah 95%, silakan lakukan fine-tuning"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"IPQKtHsBZCFZ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729524049567,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":2714,"user":{"displayName":"Aldona","userId":"04790550936434020598"}},"outputId":"2086a0c2-71b6-4f3b-ce4d-afd8771a46d8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Model accuracy: 99.96%\n"]}],"source":["correct_preds = 0\n","total_samples = 0\n","\n","with torch.no_grad():\n","    for data, labels in Test_dataset:\n","        labels = labels.squeeze()\n","        output = model.forward(data.float())\n","        output = output.squeeze(1)\n","\n","        predictions = (output >= 0.5).float()\n","        correct_preds += (predictions == labels).sum().item()\n","        total_samples += labels.numel()\n","\n","accuracy = correct_preds / total_samples\n","print(\"Model accuracy: {:.2f}%\".format(accuracy*100))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Kd8Td1YsV23w"},"source":["### Scoring\n","Total `#TODO` = 12\n","<br>Checklist:\n","\n","- [ ] Impor dataset dengan Pandas, gunakan fungsi \"read_by_CPU\"\n","- [ ] Hilangkan kolom ID\n","- [ ] Tentukan X (features) dan Y (target), gunakan \"data_gpu\"\n","- [ ] Pecah dataset dengan komposisi 80% train set dan 20% test set, dengan fungsi \"splitCPU\"\n","- [ ] Lakukan hal yang sama untuk data spliting, tetapi dengan fungsi \"splitGPU\"\n","- [ ] Aktifkan GPU (CUDA) sebagai device untuk training\n","- [ ] Tentukan nilai batch\n","- [ ] PERTANYAAN: Apa perbedaan hyperparameters dan parameters?\n","- [ ] Tentukan hyperparameters\n","- [ ] Tentukan besaran input untuk model\n","- [ ] PERTANYAAN: Mengapa total \"trainable parameters\" sama dengan total keseluruhan parameter?\n","- [ ] Jika akurasi masih dibawah 95%, silakan lakukan fine-tuning"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nu54eCVrV23w"},"source":["### Additional readings\n","- N/A"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8lozabSPV23w"},"source":["### Copyright © 2024 Startup Campus, Indonesia\n","* Prepared by **Nicholas Dominic, M.Kom.** [(profile)](https://linkedin.com/in/nicholas-dominic)\n","* You may **NOT** use this file except there is written permission from PT.
